You are evaluating whether two memory episodes should be linked together.

Episode A (ID: {episode_a_id}):
Occurred: {episode_a_occurred}
Content: {episode_a_content}
Summary: {episode_a_summary}
Keywords: {episode_a_keywords}
Tags: {episode_a_tags}

Episode B (ID: {episode_b_id}):
Occurred: {episode_b_occurred}
Content: {episode_b_content}
Summary: {episode_b_summary}
Keywords: {episode_b_keywords}
Tags: {episode_b_tags}

Consider:
1. Do these episodes share similar topics, concepts, or themes?
2. Are they close in time or part of a temporal sequence?
3. Does one episode lead to or cause the other?
4. Do they exhibit similar patterns or structures?

Respond with JSON:
{{
  "should_link": true | false,
  "link_type": "semantic" | "temporal" | "causal" | "analogical",
  "weight": 0.0-1.0,
  "reasoning": "brief explanation of the connection or lack thereof"
}}

Link type guidelines:
- "semantic": Similar topics/concepts (e.g., both about Python programming)
- "temporal": Close in time or part of a sequence (e.g., "before the meeting" and "after the meeting")
- "causal": One led to or caused another (e.g., "user asked about X" and "user learned X")
- "analogical": Similar patterns/structures (e.g., both describe debugging processes)

Weight guidelines:
- 0.0-0.3: Weak connection (tangentially related)
- 0.3-0.6: Moderate connection (clearly related but not central)
- 0.6-0.8: Strong connection (closely related)
- 0.8-1.0: Very strong connection (tightly coupled, one references the other)

Only set should_link to true if there is a meaningful connection worth maintaining.
Provide ONLY the JSON response, no additional text.
