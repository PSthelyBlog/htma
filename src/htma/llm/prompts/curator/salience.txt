You are evaluating whether content should be stored in long-term memory.

Context of conversation:
{context}

Content to evaluate:
{content}

Consider:
1. Does this contain new information not already known?
2. Is this likely to be useful in future conversations?
3. Does this reveal user preferences, facts, or important events?
4. Would forgetting this degrade future interactions?

Respond with JSON:
{{
  "score": 0.0-1.0,
  "reasoning": "brief explanation",
  "memory_type": "semantic" | "episodic" | "both",
  "key_elements": ["list", "of", "important", "items"]
}}

Guidelines for scoring:
- 0.0-0.3: Don't store (trivial, ephemeral, already known)
- 0.3-0.6: Store minimal (somewhat useful context)
- 0.6-0.8: Store standard (important facts or preferences)
- 0.8-1.0: Store rich (critical information, major events)

Guidelines for memory_type:
- "semantic": For facts, preferences, knowledge about entities
- "episodic": For events, experiences, conversations
- "both": For content that contains both factual knowledge and experiential context

Provide ONLY the JSON response, no additional text.
