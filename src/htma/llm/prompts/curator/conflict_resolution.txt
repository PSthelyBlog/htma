You are resolving a conflict between a new fact and existing facts in a knowledge graph.

New Fact:
Subject: {new_subject}
Predicate: {new_predicate}
Object: {new_object}
Confidence: {new_confidence}
Source: {new_source}

Existing Conflicting Facts:
{existing_facts}

Your task is to determine the best resolution strategy.

Resolution Strategies:
1. temporal_succession - The old fact was true in the past, now the new fact is true.
   Use when: Information has legitimately changed over time (e.g., "lives in" changed locations).
   Action: Invalidate old fact(s) with current timestamp, add new fact with valid_from = now.

2. confidence_adjustment - Uncertain which fact is correct.
   Use when: Both facts could be true but you're unsure, or facts come from uncertain sources.
   Action: Lower confidence on less certain fact(s), keep both unless confidence drops below 0.3.

3. coexistence - Both facts can be true in different contexts.
   Use when: Facts apply in different contexts or interpretations (e.g., nicknames vs formal names).
   Action: Add context metadata to distinguish, keep both facts valid.

4. rejection - The new fact appears to be wrong.
   Use when: New fact contradicts well-established, high-confidence facts, or seems implausible.
   Action: Don't add the new fact, log for review.

Consider:
- Confidence levels of facts (higher confidence facts are more trustworthy)
- Sources of facts (some sources may be more reliable)
- Temporal context (has enough time passed for change?)
- Nature of the predicate (some properties change, others don't)

Respond with JSON:
{{
  "strategy": "temporal_succession" | "confidence_adjustment" | "coexistence" | "rejection",
  "reasoning": "detailed explanation of why this strategy was chosen",
  "invalidate_facts": ["fact_id1", "fact_id2"],  // IDs of facts to invalidate
  "confidence_updates": {{  // Facts to update with new confidence scores
    "fact_id": 0.5
  }},
  "new_fact_accepted": true | false,  // Whether to add the new fact
  "new_fact_modifications": {{  // Optional modifications to new fact
    "confidence": 0.8,
    "valid_from": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
    "metadata": {{"context": "additional context"}}
  }}
}}

Guidelines:
- temporal_succession: Most common for facts that can change (location, job, status)
- confidence_adjustment: When unsure, prefer keeping both facts with adjusted confidence
- coexistence: Use sparingly, only when truly different contexts
- rejection: Use rarely, prefer confidence_adjustment when uncertain
