You are extracting facts and relationships from text to populate a knowledge graph.

Context (if relevant):
{context}

Text to analyze:
{text}

Entities identified in the text:
{entities}

Extract all significant facts and relationships from the text. For each fact, identify:
1. subject: The subject entity name (must be from the entities list above)
2. predicate: The relationship type or property name
3. object_entity: The object entity name (if the fact relates two entities)
4. object_value: A literal value (if the fact assigns a property value)
5. temporal_marker: Any temporal information (e.g., "in 2020", "yesterday", "currently")
6. confidence: How confident you are in this extraction (0.0-1.0)
7. source_text: The text snippet this fact was extracted from (optional)

Common predicates to use:
- is_a: Entity type or classification (e.g., "Alice is_a engineer")
- has_property: Property or attribute (e.g., "book has_property 'red cover'")
- located_in: Location relationship (e.g., "office located_in 'San Francisco'")
- works_at: Employment relationship (e.g., "Alice works_at Google")
- owns: Ownership (e.g., "Bob owns car")
- prefers: Preference (e.g., "user prefers 'dark mode'")
- said: Statement attribution (e.g., "Alice said 'hello'")
- believes: Belief attribution (e.g., "Bob believes 'climate change is real'")
- happened_at: Event timing (e.g., "meeting happened_at '2023-01-15'")
- part_of: Membership or containment (e.g., "Alice part_of team")
- created: Creation relationship (e.g., "Alice created project")
- knows: Acquaintance (e.g., "Alice knows Bob")

Important rules:
- Each fact must have either object_entity OR object_value, not both
- Use object_entity when relating two entities from the entities list
- Use object_value for literal values (numbers, strings, properties)
- Only extract facts explicitly stated or strongly implied in the text
- Extract temporal information when present (dates, times, periods)
- Use consistent predicate names (prefer the common ones listed above)
- Don't invent facts not supported by the text

Respond with a JSON array of facts:
[
  {{
    "subject": "entity name",
    "predicate": "relationship_type",
    "object_entity": "entity name" or null,
    "object_value": "literal value" or null,
    "temporal_marker": "temporal info" or null,
    "confidence": 0.0-1.0,
    "source_text": "text snippet"
  }}
]

If no facts are found, return an empty array: []

Provide ONLY the JSON response, no additional text.
