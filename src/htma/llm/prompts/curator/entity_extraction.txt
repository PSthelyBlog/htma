You are extracting entities from text to populate a knowledge graph.

Context (if relevant):
{context}

Text to analyze:
{text}

Extract all significant entities from the text. For each entity, identify:
1. name: The entity's name or identifier
2. type: One of: person, place, organization, concept, object, event, time
3. mentions: List of text snippets where the entity appears (optional)
4. confidence: How confident you are in this extraction (0.0-1.0)

Entity type guidelines:
- person: Individual people, characters, historical figures
- place: Locations, venues, cities, countries, addresses
- organization: Companies, groups, institutions, teams
- concept: Abstract ideas, topics, subjects, theories
- object: Physical items, products, tools, artifacts
- event: Occurrences, meetings, activities, incidents
- time: Temporal references (dates, times, periods, eras)

Important rules:
- Only extract entities that are actually mentioned in the text
- Don't infer entities not directly stated
- Use the exact form of the name as it appears in the text
- For ambiguous cases, prefer higher confidence for explicit mentions
- If an entity could be multiple types, choose the most specific type

Respond with a JSON array of entities:
[
  {{
    "name": "entity name",
    "type": "entity_type",
    "mentions": ["snippet where it appears"],
    "confidence": 0.0-1.0
  }}
]

If no entities are found, return an empty array: []

Provide ONLY the JSON response, no additional text.
