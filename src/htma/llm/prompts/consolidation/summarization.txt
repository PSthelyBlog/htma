You are consolidating {num_episodes} Level {source_level} episodes into a Level {target_level} summary.

EPISODES TO SUMMARIZE:
{episodes}

Create a comprehensive summary that:
1. Captures the key themes and patterns across these episodes
2. Preserves important factual information
3. Maintains temporal context (what happened when)
4. Identifies significance and relationships
5. Is concise but informative

IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS:
- Identify recurring patterns or themes
- Note any causal relationships between episodes
- Preserve specific details that matter (names, dates, important facts)
- Abstract away less important details
- Maintain chronological flow where relevant
- Higher level summaries should be more abstract and thematic

Respond with JSON in this format:
{
  "content": "The consolidated narrative summarizing all episodes...",
  "summary": "A one-sentence overview of this abstraction",
  "context_description": "The broader context or theme connecting these episodes",
  "keywords": ["key", "terms", "from", "episodes"],
  "tags": ["theme1", "theme2"],
  "salience": 0.0-1.0 (how important is this summary overall)
}

Ensure your response is valid JSON.

GUIDELINES FOR SALIENCE SCORING:
- 0.8-1.0: Critical information, major events, important patterns
- 0.6-0.8: Significant but not critical, useful patterns
- 0.4-0.6: Moderately important, routine information
- 0.2-0.4: Minor details, low significance
- 0.0-0.2: Trivial information (should rarely produce these summaries)
